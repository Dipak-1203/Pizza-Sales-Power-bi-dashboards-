# 🍕 End-to-End Data Analytics Project | SQL + Power BI

👉 **Yesterday, I shared my SQL project** using a Pizza Sales dataset — today, I’ve taken it one step further by **building a Power BI dashboard** using the same data. 💻📊

I recently completed an **end-to-end data analysis project** using a Pizza Sales dataset.

## ✅ SQL Project
I wrote **13+ SQL queries** to explore key business insights such as:
- **Total Revenue & Quantity Sold**
- **Best-selling Pizzas**
- **Category & Size-wise Trends**
- **Daily/Monthly Sales Performance**

## ✅ Power BI Dashboard
Then, I built an **interactive Power BI dashboard**, fully based on **my own logic** — without any external help or templates.

**Dashboard Features:**
- Clean and simple visual layout
- Slicer filters for dynamic exploration
- Insightful charts for sales trends and product performance

## 🔍 Personal Approach
- ✅ I completed both the **SQL project** and the **Power BI dashboard** using the same dataset.
- ✅ I used **my own thinking and logic** — no copied code, no help from others.
- ✅ I am a **fresher**, and I know this may not be a company-level project — but I’m **learning fast** and committed to proving myself in future projects. 💪

This hands-on project helped me understand how to connect raw data to insights using **SQL and Power BI**. I’m proud to have completed it all **by myself.** 🙌
